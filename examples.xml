<!-- Second Group Set -->

<!-- 
The second group set is a second set of ranges/groups as in many tractors there isn't just one set of Groups.
Giants didn't implement this due to their Transmissions need to work fully automatic for people who don't want to shift manually.
So I did implement the second group set now - but of course it is just for shifting manually and not touched by the automatic.

Below you see an example transmission - part of any tractor with the realismAddon_gearbox second group set added.

- powerShift -> this attribute is set to true if the range is powershift-able. This means it can be shifted without clutch 
- preselect -> this attribute is set to true if the range is of the preselect type. This means the range will be preselected with the button - but only shifts once you hit the clutch.
				(This is for example used in the smaller MB-Tracs (700-900, 1000 - 1100) and probably some other vehicles too)
- ratio -> just as with the default (first) group set its the ratio by which the speed is reduced. Usually one of the groups is 1 and the others
			are lower. You can get this value if you calculate the speed in the range you want the value for divided by the speed in the range 
			where the value is set to 1.
- name -> optional, if left blank it will just be 1, 2, 3 etc. like with default groupts and gears. The name is displayed next to the default first group set
- isDefault -> this attribute is set to true on the group that is engaged by default - e.g. the group it starts in.
